/**Script main objective: Make the user play 5 rounds of "Rock, Paper and Scissors" against the computer.
 * 
 * Things that I need to do (ODIN recommendations):
 * - Write a function named computerPlay() that will randomly return either Rock, Paper or Scissors";
 * - Write a function that plays a single round of the game and that takes two parameters - playerSelection and computerSelection - and returns a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You lose! Paper beats Rock!"
 * OBS: Make sure that the playerSelection parameter is case insensitive! And that the functions returns the result in a function call like console.log(function());
 * - Write a game() function that calls roundPlay() 5 times and returns the winner of the game at the end!
 * OBS: Use prompt() to get the user input!;
